How to run multiple histogram.

1. First run the code to generate the input files. Code is not here in this direcory.
2. Get the energy (run get_energy.sh). This step takes a long time.
3. Run do_hist.sh. This calls 1 to 4 files based on the input parameters. All 4 files must be
run at some point, but if a later step fails, you should change the do_hist.sh to not run the 
earlier files. Some (especially step 2 take a long time).

Depending on the data you are trying to generate. This may be enough.




4. call makef.sh (compiles hist_scale_1.f90).
5. call ./hist_scale_1.exe
6. do_hist_lip_coord_group.sh - gets lipid coordination by lipid group.
7. do_hist_num_trans.sh - gets probability of transmembrane peptides.
8. do_hist_charge.sh - gets charge distribution within of system by region.

The code has be written and modified my different people over the years.
